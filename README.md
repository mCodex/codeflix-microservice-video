A repository from Fullcyle's course.

This repository has 2 projects:

- Back-end: Laravel which is the main API
- Front-end: A NextJS project which is the application's front-end

## Back-end

An API written using Laravel 6

## Front-end

A front-end application using NextJS and Typescript.

Some libraries that I used:

- Styled-Components
- Airbnb's ESlint
